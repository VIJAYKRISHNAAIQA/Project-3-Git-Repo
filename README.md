# 🧪 Real-Time Industry Test Data & Behavior – Banking/Finance App

## 🌐 Web Application Testing

### 🔍 1. **User Login & Authentication**

| Test Scenario | Test Data | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Valid Login | Email: `john.doe@bank.com`<br>Password: `John@1234` | Redirect to dashboard, session token created | Real users log in with encrypted credentials. Auth should be secure (JWT/session token), redirect must be fast (~1s). |
| Invalid Login | Email: `john.doe@bank.com`<br>Password: `wrongpass` | Error message, no redirect, log attempt | Banks log failed login attempts for fraud detection. UI shouldn't leak what part was wrong. |
| Brute Force | Multiple failed logins in < 1 min | Account temporarily locked, CAPTCHA activated | Real apps limit login attempts to prevent attacks. Often lock user after 5 wrong tries within a window. |

### 🏦 2. **Fund Transfer (Web)**

| Test Scenario | Test Data | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Valid Transfer | From: Acc#1001<br>To: Acc#1002<br>Amount: ₹5,000 | Confirmation prompt → success message → DB updated | In real banking, funds are often soft-locked before final confirmation. Delay should be minimal. |
| Insufficient Balance | Acc#1001 Balance: ₹2,000<br>Trying to send ₹5,000 | Error message: “Insufficient funds” | Banks must validate funds instantly to avoid overdrafts. May also apply fees. |
| Transfer to Invalid Account | Acc#9999 (non-existent) | Error: “Account not found” | Validations occur on server; users are informed before debiting money. |

---

### 📄 3. **Transaction History (Web)**

| Test Scenario | Test Data | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| View Past Transactions | User: John Doe<br>Period: Last 30 days | Show list: date, type, amount, balance | Users expect near real-time updates. Must show sorted, paginated data with correct date format & time zone. |
| No Transactions | User has no recent activity | “No transactions found” message | Avoid empty states with confusing UI; often show helpful tips or options. |

## 📱 Mobile Application Testing

> Mobile apps require more **behavioral testing** related to gestures, battery optimization, offline mode, etc.

---

### 🔐 1. **Biometric Login (Mobile Only)**

| Test Scenario | Test Data | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Valid Fingerprint | Registered fingerprint | App unlocked instantly | Uses device biometrics (Face ID, Fingerprint). Must fall back to PIN if fails. |
| Invalid Fingerprint | Unregistered fingerprint | Prompt: “Try again” or fall back to PIN | App must not crash or expose session. Should have biometric lock timeout. |

---

### 🔁 2. **Mobile Fund Transfer (Behavioral)**

| Test Scenario | Test Data | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Drag-and-drop transfer (UX gesture) | Swipe ₹1,000 to Contact “Alice” | Visual animation + confirmation → success | Mobile apps often simplify UI with gestures. Test animations, accidental touches, accessibility. |
| Transfer with slow/unstable internet | Switch to 2G or turn WiFi off mid-transfer | Retry prompt, “Connection lost”, transaction rollback | Apps should queue failed requests, avoid double transactions. Ensure atomicity (only once!). |

---

### 📲 3. **Push Notifications (Mobile)**

| Test Scenario | Event | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Incoming Credit | ₹10,000 credited to account | Push: “₹10,000 received from XYZ” | Real apps use FCM (Firebase) or APNs for push. Instant delivery is key. Sensitive data should be masked if device is locked. |
| Transaction Failure | Failed to transfer ₹500 | Push: “Transfer failed due to insufficient balance” | Notifications must match in-app events. Time mismatch = user confusion. |

---

### 📴 4. **Offline Mode & Session Handling**

| Test Scenario | Event | Expected Behavior | Real-World Explanation |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| App used offline | User opens app w/o internet | Show cached data, disable actions | Must display “You are offline” clearly. Use local storage / SQLite for history caching. |
| Session Timeout | User inactive >15 mins | App locks, requires re-login or PIN | Required for compliance (e.g., PCI DSS). Avoid auto logout in active usage. |

## 📊 Test Data Sources (Simulated)

| User | Email | Account No | Balance | Status |
|------|-------|------------|---------|--------|
| John Doe | john@bank.com | 1001 | ₹50,000 | Active |
| Alice Ray | alice@bank.com | 1002 | ₹20,000 | Active |
| Bob Smith | bob@bank.com | 1003 | ₹0 | Frozen |
| Admin User | admin@bank.com | — | — | Admin |

> You can extend this by adding KYC status, mobile numbers, transaction limits, etc.

## 🧠 Final Tips (From Real Industry Testing)

- **Security is non-negotiable**: Test for SQL injection, XSS, data leaks.
- **Behavioral testing matters**: Track how users respond to delays, errors, and animations.
- **Performance under load**: Use tools like JMeter or Locust to simulate 1000+ users transferring funds simultaneously.
- **Compliance checks**: Always ensure GDPR, PCI DSS, and RBI guidelines (in India) are tested.
